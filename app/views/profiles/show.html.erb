      ABOUT ME
    </div>
    <div class="mt-4 text-justify">
      Welcome! My name is Tomas, I am a web developer living mostly in Bratislava,
      Slovakia. I am passionate about programming and I like the focus on the best
      solution I can come up with. I believe the passion is the key point to keep
      improving, discovering and bringing the best value I can give.
    </div>
    <div class="mt-3 text-justify">
      Since 2014 I have been fully focusing on and working with Ruby on Rails open
      source framework together with Rails related technologies. I find it to be very
      interesting and powerful for web development and internet services. I strongly
      prefer to apply design first methodology and single competence unit tested
      classes pattern together with test driven development for which I use RSpec.
    </div>
    <div class="mt-3 text-justify">
      I am mostly interested in middle/small projects like startups where everything
      needs to be built from zero to MVP and further. My weekly capacity for the
      project is usually 28-32 hours.

      The stack I work with has always included RUBY ON RAILS since 2014 and I
      still use it. My backend/frontend proportion could be expressed like 70/30. It
      also includes:
